# RunDiceApp - Kotlin <br/> <br/>

This app relates a number to a word. You can then draw many times and use this information in board games or to choose a team. <br/><br/>
I created this app to learn more about Kotlin, to be quick and simple for the purpose. 
<br/>

You can download "myApp.apk" file and run it (cellphone) to try my app.
